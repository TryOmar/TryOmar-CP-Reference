# Project Requirements

## Repository Structure
- Repository name: TryOmar-CP-Reference
- Purpose: Provide organized, reusable code templates and solutions for competitive programming

## Required Folders
- `graph/`: Graph algorithms and problems
- `data_structures/`: Implementation of various data structures
- `math/`: Mathematical algorithms and number-theory implementations
- `strings/`: String manipulation algorithms
- `templates/`: Common templates for competitive programming
- `notes/`: Helpful tips and strategies

## File Format Requirements
- Each algorithm/data structure should be in a separate markdown (.md) file
- Code snippets should be properly formatted with syntax highlighting
- Each implementation should include:
  - Brief description of the algorithm/data structure
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Code implementation
  - Example usage
  - Notes on edge cases or limitations when applicable

## Documentation Requirements
- Clean, concise code with necessary comments
- Clear explanations of the algorithms and data structures
- Examples demonstrating the usage
- Links to relevant resources or problems when applicable

## Style Guidelines
- Consistent code style throughout the repository
- Descriptive variable and function names
- Minimal dependencies for each implementation
- Code should be optimized for competitive programming scenarios
